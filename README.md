gap = 10
sorting = "urgency"

width = 300

[display]
theme = "pastel"
padding = 8
timeout = 2000

[display.border]
size = 4
radius = 10

[display.image]
max_size = 64
margin = { right = 25 }
# For old computers you can use simplier resizing method
# resizing_method = "nearest"

[display.text]
wrap = false
ellipsize_at = "middle"

[display.title]
style = "bold italic"
margin = { top = 5 }
font_size = 18

[display.body]

margin = { top = 12 }
font_size = 16

[[theme]]
